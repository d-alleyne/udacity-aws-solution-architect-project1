According to Amazon, a single AZ outage is detected automatically and 
doesn't require human intervention. The process can take up to 2 minutes, 
https://youtu.be/uiiS1h4PSI8, so I estimate that the minimum RTO and RPO
for a single AZ failure is 2 minutes. A single region failure requires human 
intervention, and thus requires:
 - being alerted of the failure (5 minutes),
 - promoting the read replica as the new active instance (5 minutes)
 - creating a read replica replacement (10 minutes). 
Thus, the minimum RTO for a single region outage is 20 minutes, 
and the minimum RPO of the region outage is 5 minutes.
